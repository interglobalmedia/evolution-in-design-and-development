# The Evolution of Design and Development

## A Melting Pot

#### Note: 

My `presentation` for `React Camp` at `Open Camps NYC November 18, 2017`, entitled `Evolution of Design and Development: A Melting Pot`. Originally made with Formidable Labs' Spectacle Slide Deck created with React, but now made with ***Brent Jackson***'s [MDX-Deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck). This too is `built` with `React`, and is a `mix` of `React` and `Markdown`. Love it, and a real pleasure to work with.

1.23.19: I am in the process of updating this presentation and its resources. Alost there. Will keep everyone posted as to its completed update.
