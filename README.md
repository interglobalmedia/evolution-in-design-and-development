# The Evolution of Design and Development

## A Melting Pot

#### Note: 

My `presentation` for `React Camp` at `Open Camps NYC November 18, 2017`, entitled `Evolution of Design and Development: A Melting Pot`. Originally made with Formidable Labs' Spectacle Slide Deck created with React, but now made with ***Brent Jackson***'s [MDX-Deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck). This too is `built` with `React`, and is a `mix` of `React` and `Markdown`. Love it, and a real pleasure to work with.

Much, however, has changed since I gave the presentation, so some information imparted here might be a bit outdated. I will try and update this deck to reflect current implementations when I have a chance! But there is some great historical information which is definitely worth read, and much is still quite relevant in the realm of design and development. If you are a seasoned developer, you will know what to do to bring things up to date. If you are not, still I encourage you to give it a whirl!
